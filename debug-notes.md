# Debug Notes

## Issue 1: Map tiles not loading — FIXED
Switched from Stadia Maps to CartoDB Voyager tiles. Map now loads properly.

## Observation: UI looks good
- Map renders correctly centered on Singapore
- Title badge with heart icon and botanical corner decoration visible
- "Add a Memory" button with gradient styling visible at bottom
- Modal opens with smooth animation
- Form fields: photo upload, caption, location dropdown all present
- Paper texture background on modal is subtle but present
- Floating hearts visible in background

## Next: Need to test full flow
- Upload an image
- Fill caption
- Select location
- Submit
- Verify pin appears
- Click pin to test polaroid reveal animation
