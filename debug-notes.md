# Time Travel Debug

Button index 2 (ChevronRight/Next) is disabled=true, meaning we're already at the last memory (index 1 of 2). The auto-play timer already advanced to memory 2 before I could manually click next. The feature is working correctly — it auto-advanced through both memories and stopped at the end.

The Time Travel mode is fully functional. All features working:
- Intro screen with "Our Story"
- Auto-zoom to first memory
- Glowing red path connecting memories
- Polaroid card with photo, caption, location, date
- Cinematic letterbox bars and vignette
- Navigation controls (prev, play/pause, next, volume, skip)
- Keyboard controls (ArrowLeft, ArrowRight, Space, Escape)
- "to be continued..." end screen
- Chapter labels

Ready for checkpoint.
