# Singapore Love Map — Design Brainstorm

<idea>

## Idea 1: "Watercolor Love Letter"

**Design Movement**: Romantic Watercolor / Stationery Art  
**Core Principles**:
1. Soft, hand-painted aesthetic — everything feels like it was drawn on thick watercolor paper
2. Warm blush and cream tones dominate, with ink-line accents
3. Organic shapes — no hard rectangles, everything has soft edges and bleed
4. The map itself has a hand-drawn, illustrated quality

**Color Philosophy**: Cream (#FFF8F0) base, blush pink (#F4B4C0), dusty rose (#D4838F), warm gold (#D4A574), soft charcoal (#4A4A4A) for text. The palette evokes a love letter written on aged paper.

**Layout Paradigm**: Full-bleed map with floating paper-like panels. The "Add Memory" button is a wax-seal icon. Modals appear like unfolded letters.

**Signature Elements**:
- Watercolor wash backgrounds on panels
- Ink-line heart illustrations as pin markers
- Paper grain texture on all card surfaces

**Interaction Philosophy**: Gentle, organic — things unfold, bloom, and drift rather than snap or slide.

**Animation**: Pins pulse with a soft watercolor bleed effect. Polaroids unfold like opening a letter. Hearts drift like petals in wind.

**Typography System**: "Playfair Display" for titles (elegant serif), "Patrick Hand" for captions (handwritten), system sans for UI labels.

## Idea 2: "Neon Night Singapore"

**Design Movement**: Cyberpunk Romance / Neon Noir  
**Core Principles**:
1. Dark map base with glowing neon accents — love in the city at night
2. Hot pink and electric magenta as primary accent on deep navy/black
3. Contrast between the darkness of the map and the warmth of the memories
4. Urban energy meets intimate moments

**Color Philosophy**: Deep navy (#0A0E1A) base, hot pink (#FF2D7B), electric magenta (#FF6B9D), soft white (#F0E6F6), neon glow effects. The palette captures Singapore's nightlife energy mixed with romance.

**Layout Paradigm**: Dark fullscreen map with floating glass-morphism panels. Bottom sheet slides up with frosted glass effect. Pins glow like neon signs.

**Signature Elements**:
- Neon glow heart pins that pulse
- Glass-morphism panels with backdrop blur
- Scanline/grain overlay for texture

**Interaction Philosophy**: Electric and punchy — things pop, glow, and spark. Clicks trigger neon flashes.

**Animation**: Pins have neon flicker. Polaroids materialize with a digital glitch then settle. Heart burst is an explosion of glowing particles.

**Typography System**: "Space Grotesk" for titles (modern geometric), "Patrick Hand" for captions, monospace accents for UI details.

## Idea 3: "Pressed Flower Journal"

**Design Movement**: Botanical Scrapbook / Cottagecore Romance  
**Core Principles**:
1. The entire interface feels like a personal scrapbook or journal
2. Muted, earthy tones with pops of dried-flower colors
3. Layered textures — linen, kraft paper, pressed flowers, washi tape
4. Asymmetric, collage-like layouts that feel hand-arranged

**Color Philosophy**: Linen white (#F5F0EB) base, sage green (#A8B5A0), dried rose (#C4878E), warm terracotta (#C4836A), cream (#F0E8D8), soft brown (#8B7355). The palette evokes a pressed-flower journal found in a vintage bookshop.

**Layout Paradigm**: Map occupies the full viewport with a warm-toned tile style. Panels appear as torn-edge paper scraps pinned to the screen. The form modal is a journal page.

**Signature Elements**:
- Torn/deckled paper edges on all panels
- Washi tape accents on Polaroid corners
- Botanical line-art decorations scattered subtly

**Interaction Philosophy**: Tactile and handmade — things feel pinned, taped, and pressed. Movements are gentle with slight wobble.

**Animation**: Pins are small pressed-flower hearts that bloom on hover. Polaroids slide in like being pulled from a journal pocket with a slight paper-rustle feel. The burst effect is scattered dried petals.

**Typography System**: "Cormorant Garamond" for titles (elegant book serif), "Patrick Hand" for captions (handwritten), "DM Sans" for UI elements.
